3. Write a simple Python script to train a machine learning model:
   - Create a Python script (e.g., `train_model.py`) that includes your machine learning code using your chosen library or framework.

4. Commit your code to the repository and push it to GitHub:
   - Initialize a local Git repository in your project folder using the following commands in your terminal:
     ```bash
     git init
     git add .
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     ```
   - Link your local repository to the GitHub repository you created:
     ```bash
     git remote add origin <GitHub Repository URL>
     ```
   - Push your code to GitHub:
     ```bash
     git push -u origin master
     ```

**Step 2: Docker Containerization**

1. Write a Dockerfile:
   - Create a Dockerfile (e.g., `Dockerfile`) in your project directory. Here's an example for a basic Python-based ML project:

     ```Dockerfile
     # Use a base image with Python
     FROM python:3.8-slim

     # Set the working directory
     WORKDIR /app

     # Copy the requirements file into the container
     COPY requirements.txt .

     # Install dependencies
     RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

     # Copy your machine learning code into the container
     COPY . .

     # Define the command to run your script
     CMD ["python", "train_model.py"]
     ```

2. Build a Docker image:
   - Build the Docker image from your Dockerfile using the following command in your terminal (replace `<image-name>` with a suitable name):
     ```bash
     docker build -t <image-name> .
     ```

3. Push the Docker image to a container registry:
   - You can use a container registry like Docker Hub, Google Container Registry, or Amazon ECR to store your Docker image.
   - Push your Docker image to your chosen registry using appropriate commands (e.g., `docker push`).

**Step 3: Cloud Deployment**

1. Deploy your Dockerized machine learning model to a cloud platform:
   - Deploy your Docker container to a cloud platform of your choice (AWS, Azure, or GCP).
   - Document the deployment process in your `README.md`.


**Step 4: Automated Testing**

1. Write simple unit tests:
   - Write unit tests for your machine learning code using a testing framework like `pytest` or `unittest`.

2. Set up a continuous integration (CI) pipeline:
   - Choose a CI service (e.g., Travis CI, GitLab CI, or CircleCI).
   - Configure your CI service to run the unit tests automatically on every push.
